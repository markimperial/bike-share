# Capstone - Google Data Analytics - Cyclistic Ridership Report
## Background Info:
Cyclistic, a fictitious bike share company, needs ridership data in order to build a marketing campaign aimed at converting casual riders to annual members.

The financial team has determined that members are much more profitable. In the deliverable, include the data analysis process taken, analysis and next steps for the company.

I've saved the SQL code snippets in this repo, with the possibility of importing the entire project at a later time.
